# Generic_LoRa

Todo: python implementation of standard LoRa demodulator
      Need: interfaces (thinking udp socket, basic file (of different formats), gnu-radio block, using RTL-SDR provided inputs
      
      demodulator will be basic, no colision resolution, one SF and BW at a time
      
      Should account for CFO as well.
